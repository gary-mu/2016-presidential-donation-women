      Do Women Donate More to Women and Liberal candidates?
    </h1>

    <p>
A New York Times article quoted from a Crowdpac research that in political contributions, "women give more to liberals and to other women." This visualization takes Ohio state as a case, to examine if women indeed donate more to liberals and to women candidates. Looking at the condaidates that still remains as of February 20th, 2016, it seems that for the 2016 Presidential election, women do donate more to female candidate(Hilary): 62% of her donors are female donors, 60% higher than overall average. When it comes to ideology, women also tend to donate more to liberals than conservatives, as liberal candidates either have on par or higher than average of women donating to them (Sanders and Hilary) comparing to their Republican counterparts. Click on the candidates in the chart below to examine the donations proportions by gender for each candidate')
