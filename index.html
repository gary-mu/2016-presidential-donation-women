      Do female candidates receive more support proportionally from women to men?

      <p id='summary' >
        A Crowdpac research concluded that "women give more [political contributions] to women candidates." This visualization takes Ohio state as a case to examine if this is true by looking at the 2016 Presidential election condaidates that still remain as of February 20th. 
        <br><br>

        Looking at the total donation amount, Kasich (Governor of Ohio) received the most donations from women (712 thousand dollars) than do Clinton (458 thousand dollars), who is the only female candidate reamined in the race. However, if we look at the donation amount by gender proportion within each candidate's supporter base, Clinton actually is the only candidate that has female as the majority in her supporter base -- 62% of Clinton's supporters are female, which is 60% higher than overall average.
